REDEMPTION OF MAN

Darkness and light prevailed among the face of the earth since the beginning of ages. Man chose to be in the darkness rather
 than being in the light and with this he chose Hatred over Love, conflicts over peace and death over life.

The Man was lost among the shadows of darkness and Death, but then rose a Light whose love paid it all.

Join us as we witness the redemption of man through ‘His’-Story.
