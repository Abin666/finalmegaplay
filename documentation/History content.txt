2013 Who is this Man?

Faith by itself isnt enough unless it produces good deeds, it is useless and dead. Though James followed the commandments to the book,
he was never able to understand and support Jesus in the path he walked despite being his brother. It was only when he saw him ressurected
did he realize how foolish he had been. Similarly we too fail to understand the importance of God’s work and the beautiful plan he has in store for us. 
When James realized his responsiblity in accordance with how much his brother sacrificed for us all so that our sins may be forgiven, 
he set out on a mission to spread the word and love of God. This was the great inspiring feat of the man called Jesus. As such it is too our responsibility to 
carry forward the good news to all our brothers and sisters in Christ and live a life pleasing to him.
